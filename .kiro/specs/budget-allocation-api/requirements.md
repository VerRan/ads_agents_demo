# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a REST API service that exposes the existing budget allocation agent functionality to frontend applications. The API will allow frontend clients to submit advertising campaign data and receive budget optimization recommendations based on daily budget constraints and target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) goals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to call a REST API endpoint to get budget allocation recommendations, so that I can integrate the budget optimization functionality into web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/budget-allocation` with valid CSV data, daily budget, and target ROAS THEN the system SHALL return budget optimization recommendations in JSON format
2. WHEN the API receives invalid input data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive error messages
3. WHEN the API processes a request successfully THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 status with structured JSON response containing campaign recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to upload CSV files containing campaign data, so that I can get budget recommendations for multiple campaigns at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a multipart/form-data request is made with a CSV file THEN the system SHALL accept and process the file
2. WHEN the uploaded CSV file has invalid format or missing required columns THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation error details
3. WHEN the CSV file is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL use the data for budget allocation analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle concurrent requests efficiently, so that multiple users can get budget recommendations simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests are made concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them without blocking
2. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 30 seconds for typical datasets
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and resource management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API response formats, so that I can reliably parse and display the budget recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns budget recommendations THEN the system SHALL include campaign_id, current_budget, current_roas, new_budget, adjustment_amount, adjustment_percentage, action_type, reason, and risk_level for each campaign
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a consistent error response format with error code, message, and details
3. WHEN the API response is generated THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP headers for content type and CORS support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand how to integrate with the budget allocation service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger specification
2. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL include request/response examples for all endpoints
3. WHEN integrating with the API THEN the system SHALL provide clear error code definitions and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track API usage and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details, processing time, and outcomes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN the system is running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
