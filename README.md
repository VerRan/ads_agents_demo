- **Search and Analysis**
  - Exa API - For website content search and analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome/Chromium browser (for browser automation)
- FFmpeg (for video processing)
- AWS account with access to Bedrock and Nova Pro models
- Docker (optional, for VNC server)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VerRan/ads_agents_demo.git
cd ads_agents_demo
```

2. Set up the Ads Analysis module:
```bash
cd ads_analysis
pip install -r combined_requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the Video Classification Agent:
```bash
cd ../ads-videos-classify-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

5. Set required environment variables:
```bash
# For Exa API
export API_KEY="your-exa-api-key"

# For AWS (if not using aws configure)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```

## Usage

### Running the Integrated UI

```bash
cd ads_analysis
python run_combined_ui.py
```

This will launch the combined UI that provides access to both website analysis and video classification features.

### Running the Video Classification Agent Separately

```bash
cd ads-videos-classify-agent
streamlit run app.py
```

The video classification application will be available at http://localhost:8501

### Browser Automation Setup

1. Start Chrome/Chromium with CDP support:
```bash
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

2. Set up VNC server (optional, for remote viewing):
```bash
docker run -p 6081:6081 -p 5901:5901 -d --name vnc-browser dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc
```

3. Configure CDP connection in the UI:
   - Local connection: `http://localhost:9222`
   - Remote connection: Enter the remote CDP URL

## Example Workflows

### Website Analysis Workflow

1. Launch the integrated UI
2. Navigate to the "Website Analysis" tab
3. Enter the target website URL
4. Select analysis options (product, competitor, market, audience)
5. Click "Analyze Website"
6. Review the generated analysis report

### Video Classification Workflow

1. Launch the video classification agent
2. Choose your preferred method (upload, URL, or chat)
3. Provide the video file or URL
4. Initiate the analysis
5. Review the video content understanding and classification results
6. (Optional) Ask follow-up questions about the video content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Connection Failures**
   - Ensure Chrome/Chromium is running with remote debugging enabled
   - Verify the CDP URL is correct (default: http://localhost:9222)
   - Check network connections and firewall settings
   - Try restarting the browser with the debugging port

2. **VNC Viewer Issues**
   - Ensure the VNC server is running properly
   - Verify port mappings are correct (default: 6081)
   - Try accessing the VNC URL directly in a new tab
   - Check Docker container status with `docker ps`

3. **API Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure EXA_API_KEY environment variable is correctly set
   - Verify AWS credentials are valid and have necessary permissions
   - Check that your AWS account has access to the required models

4. **Video Processing Issues**
   - Check that FFmpeg is properly installed
   - Ensure video files are in supported formats
   - Verify AWS permissions for accessing Nova Pro model
   - Check temporary directory permissions

## Performance Optimization

- For large videos, consider reducing resolution or length before processing
- Use local CDP connections when possible for faster browser automation
- Adjust the number of browser steps based on website complexity
- Consider batch processing for multiple videos

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional AI models for specialized analysis
- Support for more video formats and sources
- Enhanced reporting with data visualization
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Multi-language support for global marketing analysis
